# FOOD CLASSIFICAITON

This project is designed to tackle this challenge by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify food images accurately. With the help of the Food-101 dataset, which features over 101,000 images across 101 categories, we aim to build a model that doesn’t just identify food but does so with high precision.
